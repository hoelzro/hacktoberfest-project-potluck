# Hacktoberfest Project Potluck

Remember the good ol' days of Hacktoberfest, where every project was implicitly participating and you could hoard your contribution ideas until October and then get your shirt in a flurry of productivity?  The days before some guy ruined it by clueing randos into free t-shirts via low-quality PRs?  The last few years we've had to get creative, so here's a new (hopefully) creative idea on restoring some of the fun to Hacktoberfest!

Basically, the idea is that everyone pools together ideas for projects they've had, have wanted to work on, but have never started.  We discuss and pick 2-3 "winners", and actually _start_ on them!

# Rules

  - Please bring concrete project ideas - nothing like "I want to learn Rust" or "I want to play with eBPF".  You _are_, however, highly encouraged to use these projects as a vehicle for those vague goals - please feel free to mention that when we're deliberating on project ideas!
  - Please only bring fresh, unstarted ideas - don't be like [this lady](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/139176.The_Quiche_of_Death).
    - We might relax this rule later on - I dunno `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
